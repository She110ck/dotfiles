# thinkfan Example Config File
# ============================
#
# Please read the config manpage thinkfan.conf(5) before playing around with
# this.
#
# This is NOT a working config file that can just be copied. It is only meant
# to give a rough idea what can be done. In particular, don't copy & paste the
# fan speed config! Think about what you're doing.
#
# If you don't know what temperatures are right for your system, you should
# not be using thinkfan!

# Sensor Drivers and Temperature Inputs
# =====================================
#
# ATTENTION: The order in which sensors are specified here is significant when
# specifying the fan speeds further below!
#
# There are multiple ways in which a temperature input can be specified. An
# example for each is given below.
#
# The "correction:" and "optional:" keywords may be specified on any type of
# sensor.

### Use pwm(hwmon) or tpacpi

sensors:
  # hwmon: Full path to a temperature file (single sensor).
  # =======================================================
  # Disadvantage is that the index in "hwmon0" depends on the load order of
  # the driver modules, which may change across bootups on some systems.
  # TODO: enable if something goes wrong
  # - hwmon: /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon4/temp1_input


  # tpacpi: Legacy interface to the thinkpad_acpi driver
  # ====================================================
  # Particularly on older Thinkpad laptops, this interface may give access to
  # 8-16 temperature sensors, but it may be hard to tell where/what exactly
  # they measure.
  # Some documentation for older models may be found at the thinkpad wiki:
  # https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Thermal_Sensors
  # TODO: enable if something goes wrong
  # Note that the hwmon interface is to be preferred nowadays.
  - tpacpi: /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal
  #  # Some of the temperature entries in /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal may be
  #  # irrelevant or unused, so individual ones can be selected:
  #  indices: [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Fan Drivers
# ===========
#
# Currently, thinkfan supports only one fan, but support for multiple fans is
# in development and will be released soon. For the time being, the examples
# given below are mutually exclusive.
#
fans:
  # hwmon: Full path to a PWM file
  # ==============================
  # Also subject to the potential problem with driver load order (see above)
  #- hwmon: /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon4/pwm1

  # hwmon: Path to a complete driver folder
  # =======================================
  #- hwmon: /sys/class/graphics/fb0/device/hwmon
  #  indices: [1] # Use pwm1

  # hwmon: Base path with name-based search
  # =======================================
  #- hwmon: /sys/class/hwmon
  #  name: amdgpu
  #  indices: [1]

  # tpacpi: Thinkpad-specific fan interface
  # =======================================
  # Currently, this is the only way to use disengaged and automatic mode on
  # thinkpads.
  - tpacpi: /proc/acpi/ibm/fan

# Fan Speeds (simple mode)
# ========================
# 
# In simple mode, each entry is a [FANSPEED, LOWER_LIMIT, UPPER_LIMIT] tuple.
# This is a quick way to configure a small system like a laptop, where the
# temperature ratings for all monitored devices are similar. Only the highest
# temperature found across all sensors will be compared against these limits.
# All other temperatures are ignored.
#
# Correction values on individual sensors (see above) may be used to equalize
# small discrepancies in temperature ratings.
#
# The FANSPEED values in this example are valid for the thinkpad_acpi fan
# driver only (see above)
#
levels:
  - [0, 0, 50]
  - ["level auto", 45, 75]
  - ["level disengaged", 70, 255]

##############################################################################
# Fan Speeds (detailed mode)
# ==========================
#
# It is generally advisable to configure the temperature limits for each
# sensor individually.
#
# The speed values used here range from 0 to 255, which is valid for the PWM
# control files used by hwmon-based drivers.
#
# The temperatures specified in upper_limit and lower_limit apply to the
# sensors in the same order in which they were specified in the "sensors:"
# section above, and their length must match the total number of sensors that
# have been configured.
#
#levels:
#  - speed: 0
#    upper_limit: [50, 50, 50]
#
#  - speed: 100
#    lower_limit: [45, 45, 45]
#    upper_limit: [65, 65, 65]
#
#  - speed: 255
#    lower_limit: [60, 60, 60]
